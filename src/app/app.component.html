        <p>Sentiment classification is the task of assigning a sentiment label to a piece of text. The sentiment classifiys the general mood of the user
          writing the text and is separated through 3 classes:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Positive</li>
          <li>Negative</li>
          <li>Neutral</li>
        </ul>
        <p>It has been an ongoing research task for years and different rules, dictionaries and machine learning algorithms have been proposed to solve
          the problem of sentiment classification. In the demo UI below you can try out a log linear model with manual feature engineering. Altough this is not
          state of the art anymore, it provides decent results and is easy to train, even on slow machines.
        </p>
        <p>The main process behind the scenes extracts the tokens using a simple tokenizer, then stems them and puts them in lowercase. Additionally, bigrams of the 
          tokens are created to help the model identify relationsships between words. Stopwords are removed after tokenization as well. The model trains based on the labels (class labels)
          related to a specific text and learns features for both classes, positive and negative. With the help of these features, a probability can be calculated, which sums up
          all feature probabilities, to which degree the text is more negative or positive.
